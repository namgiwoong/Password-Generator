## Usage

When the number between 8 through 128 are inputted, it will guide through if the user wants to include numbers, special characters, lowercase, or uppercase for the password. Once the user selects 'ok' for yes or 'cancel' for no, it will automatically generate the password corresponding to the length and character of the password the user decided. When failed to put anything other than the number between 8 to 128, it will alert and return to beginning. It will also alert different message if the user selects 'cancel' for all the options.
